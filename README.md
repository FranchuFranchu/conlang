# Falakas

Falakas is a constructed language with the goal of being easy and intuitive to learn and pronounce by speakers of most languages, and also the goal of making poetry and prose easy and fun.

## Phonology

These are the consonants the language has:

The strong/weak distinction is necessary for inflection in a way that will be explained later.

However, a speaker can still speak the language by only pronouncing these consonants.

These are the vowels the language has.

The closed vowels can be pronounced as approximants in some situations.

### Phonotactics

The syllable structure is `(C(G))V(F)`, where `G` is either /i/ or /u/, and `F` is either a nasal, a liquid, a silbant, /i/, or /u/. /i/ and /u/ can also be pronounced as /j/ or /w/. 

The language does not distinguish between silbants in coda position, nasals in coda position, or liquids in coda position. So /kam.pa/ and /kan.pa/, /kas.ka/ and /kax.ka/, /kal.ta/ and /kar.ta/ are not distinguished. Usually, a speaker will pronounce coda consonants homoorganically with the next consonant.

### Stress

The language is syllable-timed so stress is not too noticeable. I have not decided on stress rules yet.

### Other details

## Morphology

The first phoneme in a word indicates in which direction it modifies, that is, whether the head of the phrase it is in is before or after the word.

If the first phoneme is **weak**, then the word it modifies is before it (at the left).
If the first phoneme is **strong**, then the word it modifies is after it (at the right).

The strong versions of voiced plosives are voiceless plosives, the strong versions of fricatives are affricates, and the strong versions of laterals are trills.

The direction a word modifies can be changed by strengthening or weakening the first phoneme.

There are no minimal pairs of words that only differ by the strength of the first phoneme. The strength of the first phoneme of a word does not determine its meaning.

Example:
- _tan_ means "large"
- _fo_ means "thing"
- _tan fo_ is the same thing as _fo dan_

The language is, "by default", head initial. However, the fact that the direction a word modifies can be changed at will means that word order is free, and it only changes minor details.

## Grammar

In Falakas, words have no fixed part of speech. The exact meaning and role of a word depends on context it is in.

The default word order is SVO. However, by using grammatical particles, the phrases can be reordered freely as you wish. The V tends to "stick" to the O. A speaker will usually reorder the words to get the topic at the front of the sentence.

The language is ergative/absolutive.

Syllables with no onset (without a consonant) have special grammatical roles.
- "_u_" opens a noun phrase as a subclause and "_o_" closes it. You can use just one if the result can still be understood
- "_i_" opens a verb phrase  as a subclause, frequently as a relative clause and "_e_" closes it. You can use just one if the result can still be understood
- "_es_" tells us that the word it modifies is the actor of the action. It is similar to an ergative case marker.
- "_en_" tells us that the word it modifies is the one that is affected by the action . It is similar to an absolutive case marker.
- "_el_" tells us that the word it modifies is a detail to the action, not covered by the other grammar words. This can be combined with other words to specify location, destination, purpose, etc.
- "_ei_" or "_eu_" tells us that the word it modifies is the verb of the action.

Example:
- "_sa_" means "to be"
- "_iu sa is dan in fo_" -- "the thing is big"
- "_sa ei dan es fo en_" -- "the thing is big"
- "_sa dan fo_" -- "the thing is big" OR "the big thing is". (you can skip the grammar words if the result is not too ambiguous)
- "_tan sa fo_"

### Relative clauses

The only way to introduce relative clauses (or any sort of verbal phrase inside another one) is with _i_ and _e_. There are no special relative prounouns.

### Questions

You can replace the unknown data you want to ask about with _shei_ to make a wh-question.

<dl>
<dt>pfie tshei si?<dd>what did you do? (_lit._ cause you what?)
<dt>pfie sha il shei?<dd>how are yuo? (_lit._ how do you exist?)
</dl>

### Yes/No questions


## Vocabulary
### Monosyllabic roots

Some roots are one syllable long. These are "core" grammar words or other important concepts. They are decided _a priori_, with a system that associates a broad semantical meaning to each phoneme in the language. For reference, here is the list:

* /m/	Property
* /p/	Thought, Together, because the lips are put together
* /t/	Position, Movement, because the tongue moves and points at something
* /k/	Thing, isolate thing, location
* /f/	This, determinate
* /sh/ existence
* /s/	event, identity.
* /x/	moment, relationship
* /l/	speech, communication
* /a/ achieved state
* /e/ process, 
* /i/ activity, event
* /o/ A concept or variable that comes into play.
* /u/ false, negative, possibility

In coda position, they have slightly different meanings
* /n/ NASAL: An extensive property
* /l/ LIQUID: An intensive property or detail
* /s/ FRICATIVE: An action 
* /i/ FRONT: Active
* /u/ BACK: A possibility or power

This means that there is a semantic relationship between phonologically similar roots. (/sei/: To cause, /sai/: To be a consequence)

### Bisyllabic roots

Some roots are two syllables long. These are borrowed from Earth's languages, and usually refer to things from "the real world". It is better to loan morphemes with meanings that are easily recognizable in most of the world (/pa.pa/, /ma.ma/)

### Compound words

Compound words can be formed by concatenating two words. In a compound word, one word takes the role of "main" word and the other one is the "detail". Additionally, it can be either a noun-noun compound, or a verb-noun compound. There are subtle differences in word compounding to cover these cases.

If the last word is the main word, then it is strengthened. Otherwise, it is weakened.
If the main word is first, then it is a noun-noun compound. Otherwise, it is a verb-noun or adjective-noun compound, where the noun is the detail wrod.

So, for example, if _fo_ means "person" and _lito_ means "rock", then:
<dl>
<dt>fo-lito<dd>man-rock, man of rock. could mean a person that lives in a rock. a dwarf?
<dt>fo-rito<dd>rocking-man. could mean "miner", depending on the exact details of the meaning of "rocking".
<dt>lito-fo<dd>rock-man, rock of man. could mean "statue"
<dt>lito-pfo<dd>manning-rock. could be a rock that makes inanimate things animate.

## Examples

First, some vocabulary

<dl>
  <dt>'sa'<dd>to be
  <dt>'se'<dd>to change
  <dt>'sha'<dd>to exist
  <dt>'fa'<dd>this
  <dt>'fe'<dd>that
  <dt>'tes'<dd>to move or go

  <dt>'ko'<dd>place
  <dt>'tai'<dd>to
  <dt>'tau'<dd>from
  <dt>'la'<dd>an idea or message
  <dt>'le'<dd>to say
</dl>

Here are some translations

<dl>
<dt>pfia tes ui go fe dai<dd>"I go to that place"
<dt>pfia le ui i sa pan is go fe<dd>You say that that place is good (here, VOS word order is used in the last clause).
<dt>pfia tes ui go i le ei fia es sa fe pan<dd>I go to the place that you say it is good.
</dl>
