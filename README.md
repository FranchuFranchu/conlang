# Falakas

Falakas is a constructed language with the goal of being easy and intuitive to learn and pronounce by speakers of most languages, and also the goal of making poetry and prose easy and fun.

## Phonology

These are the consonants the language has:

The strong/weak distinction is necessary for inflection in a way that will be explained later.

However, a speaker can still speak the language by only pronouncing these consonants.

These are the vowels the language has.

The closed vowels can be pronounced as approximants in some situations.

### Phonotactics

The syllable structure is `(C(G))V(F)`, where `G` is either /i/ or /u/, and `F` is either a nasal, a liquid, a silbant, /i/, or /u/. /i/ and /u/ can also be pronounced as /j/ or /w/. 

The language does not distinguish between silbants in coda position, nasals in coda position, or liquids in coda position. So /kam.pa/ and /kan.pa/, /kas.ka/ and /kax.ka/, /kal.ta/ and /kar.ta/ are not distinguished. Usually, a speaker will pronounce coda consonants homoorganically with the next consonant.

### Stress

The language is syllable-timed so stress is not too noticeable. I have not decided on stress rules yet.

### Other details

## Morphology

The first phoneme in a word indicates in which direction it modifies, that is, whether the head of the phrase it is in is before or after the word.

If the first phoneme is **weak**, then the word it modifies is before it (at the left).
If the first phoneme is **strong**, then the word it modifies is after it (at the right).

The direction a word modifies can be changed by strengthening or weakening the first phoneme.

There are no minimal pairs of words that only differ by the strength of the first phoneme. The strength of the first phoneme does not determine its meaning.

Example:
- _tan_ means "large"
- _fo_ means "thing"
- _tan fo_ is the same thing as _fo dan_

The language is, "by default", head initial. However, the fact that the direction a word modifies can be changed at will means that word order is free, and it only changes minor details.

## Grammar

In Falakas, words have no fixed part of speech. The exact meaning of each word depends on context.

Frequently, the word order is VSO but you can change this, most frequently to SVO or SOV. Speakers may adjust the word order to place the most important phrase at the beginning of the sentence.

Syllables with no onset (without a consonant) have special grammatical roles.
- "_u_" opens a noun phrase as a subclause and "_o_" closes it. You can use just one if the result can still be understood
- "_i_" opens a verb phrase  as a subclause, frequently as a relative clause and "_e_" closes it. You can use just one if the result can still be understood
- "_es_" tells us that the word it modifies is the actor of the action. It is similar to an eergative case marker.
- "_en_" tells us that the word it modifies is the one that is affected by the action . It is similar to an absolutive case marker.
- "_el_" tells us that the word it modifies is a detail to the action, not covered by the other grammar words. This can be combined with other words to specify location, destination, purpose, etc.
- "_ei_" or "_eu_" tells us that the word it modifies is the verb of the action.

Example:
- "_sa_" means "to be"
- "_iu sa is dan in fo_" -- "the thing is big"
- "_sa ei dan es fo en_" -- "the thing is big"
- "_sa dan fo_" -- "the thing is big" OR "the big thing is". (you can skip the grammar words if the result is not too ambiguous)
- "_tan sa fo_"

### Relative clauses

The only way to introduce relative clauses (or any sort of verbal phrase inside another one) is with _i_ and _e_. There are no special relative prounouns.

## Examples

First, some vocabulary

<dl>
	<dt>'sa'<dd>to be
  <dt>'se'<dd>to change
  <dt>'sha'<dd>to exist
  <dt>'fa'<dd>this
  <dt>'fe'<dd>that
  <dt>'tes'<dd>to move or go
  <dt>'pan'<dd>good
  <dt>'fia'<dd>me
  <dt>'fie'<dd>you
  <dt>'fio'<dd>he/she/it
  <dt>'shan'<dd>all
  <dt>'shen'<dd>some
  <dt>'to'<dd>time or moment
  <dt>'ko'<dd>place
  <dt>'tai'<dd>to
  <dt>'tau'<dd>from
  <dt>'la'<dd>an idea or message
  <dt>'le'<dd>to say
</dl>

Here are some translations
**tes ei fia es go fe dai**: "I go to that place"
**le ei fia es i sa pan is go fe**: You say that that place is good (here, VOS word order is used in the last clause).
**tes ei fia es go i le ei fia es sa fe pan**: I go to the place that you say it is good.
