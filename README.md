# Falakas

Falakas is a constructed language with the goal of being international, and also the goal of making poetry and prose easy and fun.

## Phonology

These are the consonants the language has:

The strong/weak distinction is necessary for inflection in a way that will be explained later.

However, a speaker can still speak the language by only pronouncing these consonants.

These are the vowels the language has.

The closed vowels can be pronounced as approximants in some situations.

## Phonotactics

The syllable structure is `C(G)V(F)`, where `G` is either /i/ or /u/, and `F` is either a nasal, a liquid, a silbant, /i/, or /u/. /i/ and /u/ can also be pronounced as /j/ or /w/. 

The language does not distinguish between silbants in coda position, nasals in coda position, or liquids in coda position. So /kam.pa/ and /kan.pa/, /kas.ka/ and /kax.ka/, /kal.ta/ and /kar.ta/ are not distinguished. Usually, a speaker will pronounce coda consonants homoorganically with the next consonant.
